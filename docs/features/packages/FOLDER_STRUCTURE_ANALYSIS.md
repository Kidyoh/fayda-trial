- Used deprecated endpoints (`/packagefolder/coursemain`, `/pacakgefolder/coursesub/`, `/packages/fetchPackages/`)
- Replaced by new `/packages` page using `/packages/public/active` endpoint
- Old hierarchical folder structure is no longer used

**Files that were deleted:**

## Data Flow Diagrams

### Package Display Flow

```
Homepage (page.tsx)
  ↓
PackageCards Component
  ↓
Fetches: GET /packages/public/featured
  ↓
Displays: 2 featured packages with cards
  ↓
User clicks "View All Packages"
  ↓
/packages route
  ↓
Fetches: GET /packages/public/active
  ↓
Shows: Full list with search & filter
```

### Package Purchase Flow

```
Packages Listing Page
  ↓
User clicks "View Details"
  ↓
/details/[package-id]
  ↓
package_details_rendered.tsx
  ↓
Shows: Full package info, courses, reviews

## Links That Were Fixed

### Old Broken Links → New Working Links

1. **Navbar:**
   - ❌ `href="/#packages"` → ✅ `href="/packages"`

2. **Mobile Navbar:**
   - ❌ `href="/#packages"` → ✅ `href="/packages"`

3. **Pakages Rendered Component:**
   - ❌ `href="/explore"` → ✅ `href="/packages"`

4. **Dashboard Packages:**
   - ❌ `href="/explore"` → ✅ `href="/packages"`

5. **About Page:**
   - ❌ `href="/explore_packages"` (2 places) → ✅ `href="/packages"`

## Why Featured Packages Might Not Be Working

### Possible Issues:

1. **API Endpoint Issue:**
   - The `/packages/public/featured` endpoint might not be returning data
   - Check if backend has packages marked as `featured: true`

2. **Response Structure:**
   - Ensure backend returns `{ success: true, data: [...], count: n }`
   - Frontend expects this exact structure

3. **Image URLs:**
   - `imgUrl` is now an array - uses `imgUrl[0]` for display
   - If images fail to load, fallback emoji is shown

4. **Caching:**
   - `hasFetched.current` prevents duplicate fetches
   - May need browser cache clear

### Debug Steps:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API response in Network tab
3. Check if packages have `featured: true` in database
4. Ensure `imgUrl` array is populated

## Feature Comparison

| Feature          | Old Explore System          | New Packages System                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Endpoint**     | `/packagefolder/coursemain` | `/packages/public/active`             |
| **Navigation**   | Hierarchical folders        | Flat listing                          |
| **Search**       | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                                |
| **Filter**       | ❌ No                       | ✅ By tags                            |
| **Display**      | Folder structure            | Grid cards                            |
| **API Response** | Varies                      | Standardized `{success, data, count}` |
