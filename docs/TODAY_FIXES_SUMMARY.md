### Backend Check:

- [ ] Verify that `/packages/public/featured` endpoint exists and returns data
- [ ] Ensure at least 2 packages have `featured: true` in database
- [ ] Verify `/packages/public/active` endpoint works correctly
- [ ] Check that `imgUrl` arrays contain valid image URLs

## Testing Checklist
